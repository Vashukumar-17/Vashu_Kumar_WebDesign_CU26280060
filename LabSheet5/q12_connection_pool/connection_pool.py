"""Q12 – Connection pooling for concurrent access.

Creating a TCP connection + authenticating for every request is slow. A pool keeps connections
open and hands them out, which matters when Apache serves many requests at once.
This demo runs 50 queries on 20 threads sharing a pool of 5 connections.
