## Manual end-to-end test checklist
1. Import `database.sql` and update `config.php`.
2. Register a customer and log in.
3. Search for a book and filter by category; move through pages if enough books exist.
4. Open a book detail page, add it to wishlist, write a review.
5. Add a book to the cart; attempt a quantity above stock and verify it is capped.
6. Checkout while logged in; verify the order appears in `orders.php` and an invoice opens.
7. Register a second account, then promote the intended admin in MySQL using the README command.
8. Open Admin, add/edit a book, change an order status, and inspect the sales report.
9. Test invalid forms and confirm database data is displayed escaped.

## Security reminder
Prepared statements and HTML output escaping are used throughout. This project is still an educational example: add CSRF tokens, rate limits, stronger validation, secure deployment settings and a real payment provider before production use.
